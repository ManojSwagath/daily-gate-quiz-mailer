# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### Problem 1: Hugging Face API 404 Error
**Error:** `API error: 404 - Not Found`

**Cause:** Hugging Face deprecated the old API endpoint on November 1st, 2025

**Fix:** Updated API endpoint from:
- ❌ OLD: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/...`
- ✅ NEW: `https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/...`

### Problem 2: PDF Unicode Error with Emojis
**Error:** `FPDFUnicodeEncodingException: Character "🔥" at index 0...`

**Cause:** FPDF library doesn't support emojis with default fonts

**Fix:** Removed all emojis from:
- PDF headers (🔥, 📝, 🎓)
- Email subject line
- Console output
- Changed font from Arial to Helvetica (more compatible)

## ✅ Current Status:

- ✅ Code updated and pushed to GitHub
